        <li>Mix the ground pork and the ground beef together, add the meat into the large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Add the salt and parmesan cheese into the large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Mix everything together and roll into small balls (about the size of a ping pong ball)</li>

        <li>Heat up the olive oil until you start to see little wisps of smoke rising from the pan</li>
        <li>Heat up the sauce in a pot on medium heat until it starts to bubble up a little bit</li>
        <li>Place the balls into the pan to start to brown them up. Rotate the balls until all of the sides are fully browned</li>
        <li>Once fully browned, place meatballs into the hot spaghetti sauce and let the pot continue to simmer</li>
        <li>When the pot begins to boil, add in the spaghetti noodles and follow the cooking instructions found on the package, add salt to taste</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta when finished, and enjoy!</li>
